A "Thick of it" Muter

How it works:
it checks if the tab is loaded in then if it matches the URL of "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At8v_Yc044Y" (Thick of it YT URL) it mutes the tab and if its not it keeps it unmuted/unmutes it

How to Setup:
1. Make a folder
2. Import the files
3. Add it to your Custom Extensions
4. Enjoy!

I posted this because I didnt want to Spend 5 dollers to post a extension

Hope you enjoy! Good Luck!
